# CoolProp in ExternalMedia

ExternalMedia provides direct access to the open-source [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org) software, which is
integrated in the compiled binaries of the library, so it doesn't need any separate installation.

Please refer to the User Guide of the ExternalMedia library for instructions on how to access specific fluid models of
CoolProp. Some ready-to-use examples are provided in the Examples package.
